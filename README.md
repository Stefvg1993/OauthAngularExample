# OauthAngularExample
An Angular 4 example with user registration and login services based on Oauth authentication. This project works seamlessly with the spring boot application located at: https://github.com/Stefvg1993/OauthExample.

Only thing you have to change is the location of the Oauth server in the following files: 'proxy.conf.json' and '/src/app/shared/Properties.ts'. The rest should work out of the box.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
